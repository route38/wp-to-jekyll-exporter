# WordPress to Jekyll Exporter

Accepts a WXR (= WordPress eXtended RSS) file as input and emits a
series of markdown files you can dump into your Jekyll site.

Very raw as yet.  Do not recommend using without serious hackage, but I
will definitely be working on this as this is a utility I have wanted
for several years and finally got around to writing.

I am working on a sentiment classifier for my old diary, which I kept in
a privately hosted WordPress instance.  Extracting the post data to
plaintext from the WXR file was vitally important to this.
