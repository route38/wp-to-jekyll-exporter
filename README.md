# WordPress to Jekyll Exporter

Accepts a WXR (= WordPress eXtended RSS) file as input and emits a series of markdown files you can dump into your Jekyll site.

Very raw as yet.  Do not recommend using without serious hackage, but I will definitely be working on this as this is a utility I have wanted for several years and finally got around to writing.
